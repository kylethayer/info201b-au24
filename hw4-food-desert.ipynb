    "In this assignment you will be looking to understand characteristics of food deserts in the United States while also comparing regions classified as food desert with their non-food desert counterparts. For this assignment, we are going to use the US Department of Agriculture's definition of a food desert which is that a county is considered a food desert if 33% or more of the population in that county is located more than 1 mile (in urban counties) or 10 miles (in rural counties) from the nearest supermarket or large grocery store.\n",
